## The mobillity patterns and infrasturcture in London

Covid-19 has affected the frequency and conveyance Londoners choose. If we take a look into the montly journeys, we can see how as the restrictions start, the number of journeys dramaticly decreases. This is also supported when taking a look into the visits to **[transit stations](https://luciamontesinos.github.io/london-mobility/mobility/#areas-of-negative-change)**

However, not all boroughs count on the same transport infrastructure. Let's analyze them one by one:

### Cycle
London counts with The London Cycle Network Plus (LCN+) a  network of cycle routes of about 900 kilometres. Below is the map of the cyclable paths:

Beside the private owned bikes, London counts with a public cycle scheme with more than 11,500 bikes and 750 docking stations. However the distribution of this docking station is quite uneven.

As seen above, the most centric boroughs have the majority of the docking stations. 


If we take a look into the usage of this public bikes, overall there is an increase on the cycle hires on summer and spring, something to be expected if we keep in mind the weather. However, since covid started, the increase is way more noticeable specially whenever the **[mobility restrictions](https://luciamontesinos.github.io/london-mobility/home/#the-mobility)** are lifted.

### Public transport
If we dig into th epublic transport system, we can see how not all boroughs have the same number of bus stops.

Analogously for the rest of the TFL system, not all boroughs have the same number of Tube, DLR, Overground, Tramlink, Emirates Air Line and Crossrail stations.
