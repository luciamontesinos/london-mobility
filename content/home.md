### The impact of COVID-19 in mobility
COVID-19 has become an unprecedented change in our lives.  In order to mitigate the rapid spread of the virus,  governments from all around the globe implemented a range of social distancing policies. For Londoners, these legislations started at the beginning of March 2020, and currently, some are still in force. All of these distancing policies resulted in reduced mobility across the different London Boroughs. Throughout this interactive storyboard we will analyze the impact of COVID-19 on London mobility.

### The timeline
Although the virus was first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, the first confirmed case in London appeared on 12 February 2020. By mid-march, there were already more than 500 cases in the city, and since then the number of confirmed cases has barely stopped growing.This triggered a series of social distancing policies that were applied and lifted as the number of cases fluctuated. Below there is a timeline of the restrictions imposed in Greater London:
