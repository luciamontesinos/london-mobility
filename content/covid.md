### Covid impact in different boroughs

The first and second waves of the COVID pandemic are of interest to this investigation, as they were also accompanied by radical non-medical interventions in people's lives. Mobility was limited drastically and it is generally agreed that this was the most effective way of slowing down the spread of the virus.

The second wave saw an even longer lockdown, which makes sense as the case numbers were much higher in this period. This leaves one asking the question, what worked so well during the first lockdown that didn't during the second. We might assume weather played some role, as the first wave came as the winter was ending, but referring to the mobility data, we know there was also a fair amount of lockdown fatigue that must have contributed to increased virus spread.
