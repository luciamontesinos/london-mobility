### Total cases
London was initially one of the worst affected regions of England, reaching its peak in January of 2021.

### Covid impact in different boroughs

The first and second waves of the COVID pandemic are of interest to this investigation, as they were also accompanied by radical non-medical interventions in people's lives. Mobility was limited drastically and it is generally agreed that this was the most effective way of slowing down the spread of the virus.

### The second wave
The second wave saw an even longer lockdown, which makes sense as the case numbers were much higher in this period. This leaves one asking the question, what worked so well during the first lockdown that didn't during the second. We might assume weather played some role, as the first wave came as the winter was ending, but referring to the mobility data, we know there was also a fair amount of lockdown fatigue that must have contributed to increased virus spread.

One peculiar aspect of the winter wave, was many of the restrictions were lifted for the first few weeks of [December](https://luciamontesinos.github.io/london-mobility/home/#the-timeline). Although, as is clear from the new infections timeline above, the spread had not really slowed. Of course there is always pressure from businesses to lift lockdowns, but the timing of this relaxation of the rules just before the holidays seems suspect. The government did have a regional tiered system in place during this period, but Londoners were allowed to go shopping.  

The entire (so far) timeline of the virus in each borough can be seen in the following plot, where each borough can be selected or deselected individually.
