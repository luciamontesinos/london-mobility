Beside the private owned bikes, London counts with a public cycle scheme with more than 11,500 bikes and 750 docking stations. However the distribution of this docking station is quite uneven.

As seen above, the most centric boroughs have the majority of the docking stations.

If we take a look into the usage of this public bikes, overall there is an increase on the cycle hires on summer and spring, something to be expected if we keep in mind the weather. However, since covid started, the increase is way more noticeable specially whenever the mobility restrictions are lifted.
